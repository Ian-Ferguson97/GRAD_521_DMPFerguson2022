Data management plan for the research project of determining the adhesion strength of nickel coating on copper and stainless steel. A new methodology using high powered lasers to both lift the nickel coating and measure the strength required to do it is being explored for applications where traditional tools are not sufficiently strong enough to remove the coating being evaluated. This is of particular value to the advanced materials industry, which strives to produce complex, highly resilient coatings for extreme environments.
